# deep-milling

Experiments in deep learning, vaguely related to CNC toolpath generation.

## TODO

 - use openai gym
   - provides standardized environment class, etc.

 - use tensorboard for visualizing how training is going

 - last layers need to be linear!

 - explicitly tell the AdamOptimizer which things to optimize over

 - make function for making a layer. it can default to using relu at the end, or i can pass it no op for last layers
   - use scopes
